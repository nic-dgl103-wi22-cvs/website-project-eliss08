            <!--overview of the big 5 goes here-->
            After the Simple View of Reading, it is important to know and understand the Big 5 of Reading (Phonemic
            Awareness, Phonics, Fluency, Vocabulary and Comprehension) and their role in reading instruction. As you
            work with the phonics lessons and activities found within this book, you will notice that we are constantly
            enfolding the other Big 4 into our "phonics lessons.‚Äù This is very intentional as a rich, interplay between
            the Big 5 contributes to powerful, high impact instruction and growing strong readers.
