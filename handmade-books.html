        <h1>About Hand Made Books</h1>
        <p>
            Handmade books and reading are two things that just seem to go together! Besides being a bookmaker and mixed&mdash;media artist myself, I have some very talented book making friends. This page contains one of a kind, handmade book that are for sale. New
            books will be added as they are created, so check back often if you are interested in purchasing one or more books.
        </p>
        <p>
            Pictures, descriptions, and measurements are included in each listing, along with the price. Books will be shipped from the artist and shipping costs will depend on their destination so are not included here.
